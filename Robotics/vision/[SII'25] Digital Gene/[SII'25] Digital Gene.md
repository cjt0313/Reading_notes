2. The article does not introduce details in data preparation, traning process and concepts. Most of them lies in their previous works.
3. Rather than what they did, the authors put a major effort on describing what they could do.
## Contributions
1. a code-based representation of object geometric properties and affordance for articultated objects.
2. a tree structured that build an physical entity from parts.
