**TL;DR**
A tokenizer designed specifically for actions, handles high-frequency dexterous tasks that are impossible with standard binning-based discretization, and achieves similar levels of dexterity as flow matching or diffusion, while training 5 times faster.
For the first time it allowed us to train policies on the DROID dataset that can perform a range of manipulation tasks zero-shot in entirely new environments, simply by prompting them with natural language commands.
